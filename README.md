- Hii!! Welcoming you with great pleasure. 
- This website is designed by **GR17 ECE Students**. 
- This website maintains information about the trees present on the **GRIET campus**. 
- To know more about the trees present on the campus and to monitor them, **Geotagging** concept is implemented. 
> Geotagging is meant for **identifying**, **knowing** more about the trees and **locating** them on the map for **tracking** purposes. Information related to the trees is presented on web pages.

## The most common sections related to the trees are:
- About the tree
- The family name of the tree
- The scientific name of the tree
- Medicinal uses
- Economical uses
 > Also, a map is kept at the footer section and the pinpoint tells where the tree is.
 ##### Some trees found in **GRIET Campus** are:
 - [Mango tree](https://grietstudent.github.io/GRIETtrees/mangotree.html)

## Telegram Chatbot
A telegram widget appears at the bottom right side of [this page](https://grietstudent.github.io/GRIETtrees/). 
Upon clicking it, it directs to the chat window of the telegram bot.
The bot asks your name for an introduction and notes down the name of the tree and its whereabouts in location coordinates.
For health monitoring purposes, the bot asks whether the tree has any disease?
The user mentions the disease present in the trees based on his observation.
> After taking these responses, the bot writes the data in Google Sheets for us.
