# GRIETtrees
Welcome to this website. This website maintains information about the trees present on the GRIET campus. 
To know more about the trees present on the campus and to monitor them, Geotagging concept is implemented. Geotagging is meant for identifying and knowing more about the trees and locating them on the map for tracking purposes. Information related to the trees is presented on web pages.
The most common section related to the trees are:
About the tree
The family name of the tree
The scientific name of the tree
Medicinal uses
Economical uses
Also, a map is kept at the footer section and the pinpoint tells where the tree is.
A telegram widget appears at the bottom right side of the page.
Upon clicking it, it directs to the chat window of the telegram bot.
The bot asks your name for an introduction and notes down the name of the tree and its whereabouts in location coordinates.
For health monitoring purposes, the bot asks whether the tree has any disease?
The user mentions the disease present in the trees based on his observation.
After taking these responses, the bot writes the data in Google Sheets for us.
